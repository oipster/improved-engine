        <p class="historycontainer">Josefin Slab was created by Santiago Orozco following his first font in the same family, Josefin Sans. While Sans was his first project, he says he put much more time into this one. He took inspiration from geometric typefaces from the 30s; he utilized the typefaces Kabel and Memphis to birth Josefin Slab. He also took inspiration from Scadinavian style, specifically its diacritics. The "æ" character defined the letter “e”’s slope. Finally, he mentions that typewriter style is unique and he likes Letter Gothic typeface, which inspired Josefin Slab to be born.
